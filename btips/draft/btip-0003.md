### Abstract

This proposal outlines a series of protocol updates designed to enhance network performance and optimize token emission. The proposed changes include:  
1. Increasing throughput by raising the maximum gas cap per block.  
2. Reducing the block time to 10 seconds.  
3. Introducing a halving mechanism to gradually decrease emissions over time.  
4. Eliminating rewards for uncle blocks.

---

### Motivation

- **Enhanced Throughput:** Adjusting the gas cap per block will improve the network’s capacity to process a higher volume of transactions, ensuring future scalability.  
- **Reduced Block Time:** A 10-second block time is expected to further boost throughput and enhance the overall user experience.  
- **Halving Mechanism:** The scheduled reduction in block rewards will:
  - Incentivize miners to contribute hashpower, reinforcing network security amid decreasing rewards.
  - Encourage timely investment from both retail and institutional stakeholders.
  - Adjust the emission rate to mitigate inflationary pressures.
- **Elimination of Uncle Block Rewards:** Removing uncle block rewards will simplify the emission schedule and better align supply dynamics with the halving mechanism.

### Specification

- **Block Capacity & Block Time Adjustments:**  
  - Increase the block gas limit from 150Mgas (as specified in the original whitepaper) to 250Mgas.  
  - Reduce the block time from 15 seconds (as specified in the original whitepaper) to 10 seconds.  
  - These modifications are projected to raise the theoretical maximum throughput from approximately 476 tx/s to 1,190 tx/s—a 250% increase.

- **Uncle Block Rewards:**  
  - Regular blocks will continue to apend up to 2 uncle blocks to maintain network security and stability, though these blocks will no longer receive rewards.

- **Halving Mechanism:**  
  Implement a reward halving schedule as follows:

  | Block Interval          | Reward        | Super Epoch     |
  |-------------------------|---------------|-----------------|
  | 1 - 4,500,000           | 1 BTN/block   | 1 – Hestia      |
  | 4,500,001 - 8,000,000   | 0.5 BTN/block | 2 – Demeter     |
  | 8,000,001 - 16,000,000  | 0.25 BTN/block| 3 – Hera        |
  | 16,000,001 - 32,000,000 | 0.125 BTN/block| 4 – Poseidon   |
  | 32,000,001 - 64,000,000 | 0.0625 BTN/block| 5 – Hades     |
  | > 64,000,000            | 0.03125 BTN/block| 6 – Zeus    |

  In this schedule, the halving process is structured into “Super Epochs,” with the block interval increasing exponentially while rewards decrease accordingly until reaching a fixed rate beyond block 64,000,000.

### Rationale

The proposed updates are intended to:
- Enhance network performance and transaction capacity.
- Increase the intrinsic value of the Bitnet token.
- Adhere to the original principles outlined in Masayoshi's whitepaper concerning the currency properties of BTN, despite its uncapped supply.

These improvements are expected to drive increased usage, attract investment, and promote widespread adoption, ultimately benefiting the entire Bitnet community.

### Backwards Compatibility

The updated node codebase will not be backwards compatible with previous versions. All network participants, including miners, will be required to update their software to comply with the new protocol.

---

### Test Cases

Comprehensive testing will be conducted prior to the deployment of these updates to ensure stability and reliability.

---

### Implementation

Implementation will involve modifications to the Bitnet codebase. The changes will be proposed, rigorously tested, and subsequently released. Miners and node operators will be required to update their software accordingly.
