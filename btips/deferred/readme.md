# Deferred BTIP Proposals

This directory lists all BTIPs (Bitnet Improvement Proposals) that have been deferred. These are proposals that are not currently being actively considered or developed but may be revisited in the future.

## List of Deferred BTIPs

Template for listing
```md
- BTIP-XX: [Title of the BTIP]
  - **Author(s)**: [Name of the author(s)]
  - **Deferred**: [Date]
  - **Status**: Deferred
```

## Reconsideration
A deferred BTIP can be reconsidered for development if there is renewed interest and justification in the community. To reactivate a deferred BTIP, community members should:
- Discuss the proposal in the Bitnet community forums.
- Submit a request to change the status of the BTIP from 'Deferred' to 'Draft'.
