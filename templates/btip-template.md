# BTIP Template

This is a template for creating a Bitnet Improvement Proposal (BTIP).

## Preamble

    BTIP: <BTIP number>
    Title: <BTIP Title>
    Author: <List of authors' names and optionally, email addresses>
    Type: <Standard Track | Informational | Process>
    Status: <Draft | Accepted | Finalized | Deferred>
    Created: <date created on, in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) format>
    Requires (*optional*): <BTIP number(s)>
    Replaces (*optional*): <BTIP number(s)>

## Abstract
*A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.*

## Motivation
*Why this BTIP is being proposed. The motivation section should be clearly articulated and should justify the need for a consensus change.*

## Specification
*The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow for it to be reviewed and implemented.*

## Rationale
*The rationale section should flesh out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work.*

## Backwards Compatibility
*All BTIPs that introduce backward incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The BTIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities.*

## Test Cases
*Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for BTIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other BTIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.*

## Implementations
*The implementations must be completed before any BTIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the BTIP is accepted. It is expected that the implementation will be completed within six months of acceptance.*

## References
*References to related material, such as BTIP drafts or other BTIPs, and to external documents, should be listed at the end of the BTIP.*
