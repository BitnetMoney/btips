# Bitnet Improvement Proposals (BTIPS)

## Introduction
This repository is for Bitnet Improvement Proposals (BTIPS), which are formal documents proposing improvements to the Bitnet Protocol. The BTIPS process is modelled after Bitcoin's BIPs and Ethereum's EIPs systems, aiming to provide a standardized way for individuals and organizations to contribute to the development of Bitnet.

## What is a BTIP?
A BTIP is a design document providing information to the Bitnet community, or describing a new feature for Bitnet or its processes or environment. The BTIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

## BTIP Workflow
The BTIP process begins with a new idea for Bitnet. Each potential BTIP must start as a discussion on [one of Bitnet's community channels](https://bitnet.money/community) or as a draft proposal on this repository. After discussing and refining the idea with feedback from the community, the proposal can be submitted as a pull request to this repository.

1. **Draft**: The initial phase of a BTIP before it is formally accepted.
2. **Accepted**: The BTIP has been agreed upon and is actively being implemented.
3. **Finalized**: The BTIP has been implemented and is a part of the Bitnet protocol.
4. **Deferred**: The BTIP is not being considered for immediate implementation but might be revisited in the future.

## Contributing
Before contributing, please see the [BTIP Standard Template](https://github.com/BitnetMoney/btips/blob/main/templates/btip-template.md) document, which contains guidelines for writing BTIPs. It is recommended to discuss your ideas with the community before drafting your proposal.
  
It's important to note that the opportunity to contribute to BTIPS extends beyond developers. We welcome contributions from a diverse array of participants, including community members, industry experts, and other enthusiasts in the field. This broad approach allows us to incorporate a wide spectrum of ideas and expertise, significantly enriching the BTIPS process.

### Steps to Contribute
1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. Add your BTIP in the `Draft` folder.
3. Submit a pull request with your proposal.

## BTIP Format and Standards
Each BTIP should follow the standard format as outlined in the BTIP Standard Template. This includes a title, abstract, motivation, specification, rationale, and, if applicable, a reference implementation.
